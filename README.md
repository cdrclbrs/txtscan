[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-%E2%89%A5%203.6-yellow.svg)](https://www.python.org/) 

## Purpose
TxtScan is a small tool that simply cleans up the TXT results returned by a DIG query. Following this, duplicates are removed and a call to the GPT chat API is made to display a brief description of the service or services present. This allows for a quick snapshot of certain technologies used for a given domain.
